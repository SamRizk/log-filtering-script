# Log Filtering Script

**Author:** Samir Rizk  
**Date:** 14/08/2024

This Python script filters and analyzes log files generated by `strace`. It processes log files to extract and categorize system call data, while removing unwanted lines such as timestamps and specific error messages.

## Features

- Filters out timestamp lines and specific error messages.
- Extracts and categorizes system call data.
- Provides clean and structured output for analysis.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/log-filtering-script.git
   cd log-filtering-script
   ```

2. **Ensure Python is Installed**
   Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can check by running:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```
   If not installed, download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

3. **Install Dependencies**
   The script requires no additional Python packages beyond the standard library.

## Usage

1. **Generate the Log File with `strace`**

   To create a log file using `strace`, run your binary with `strace` and output the log to a file. For example:
   ```bash
   strace -f -o binary_trace.log binary-name
   ```
   Replace `binary-name` with the name of the executable you want to trace. This command will create a file named `binary_trace.log` containing the system call traces.

2. **Run the Log Filtering Script**

   After generating the log file, use the provided Python script to filter and analyze it. Run the script as follows:
   ```bash
   python filter_logs.py binary_trace.log
   ```
   Replace `binary_trace.log` with the path to your log file if it's named differently.

3. **View the Filtered Output**

   The script will output the filtered system call data to the console. You can redirect this output to a file if needed:
   ```bash
   python filter_logs.py binary_trace.log > filtered_output.txt
   ```
   This command will save the filtered results to `filtered_output.txt`.

## Example

Assume you have a binary named `my_program` and you want to trace its system calls:

1. Run `strace`:
   ```bash
   strace -f -o my_program_trace.log ./my_program
   ```

2. Filter the log:
   ```bash
    python c:\Users\samirizk\Desktop\studying\analyze_strace.py c:\Users\samirizk\Desktop\binary_trace.log > filtered_logs.log
   ```

3. View the filtered logs:
   ```bash
   cat filtered_logs.txt
   ```
